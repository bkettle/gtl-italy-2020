# Ben's GTL 2020 Teaching Materials

In January of 2020, I travelled to Italy to teach high school students for a month. I taught several lessons in probability, combinatorics, physics, and computer science, and made all the course materials myself. I thought I would put them here for other people to draw inspiration from or even use in their own teaching adventures. Let me know if you have any questions.

I make no guarantees on the accuracy of the content.
